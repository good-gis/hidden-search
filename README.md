## 🔧 How It Works

This widget features a hidden search bar that is activated by clicking a button with a search icon from Font Awesome. When the button is clicked, a JavaScript event toggles a class that adds a CSS transition, causing the search bar to expand while moving the button using a transform translate X. Clicking the button again will shrink the search bar back.

The project leverages CSS transitions for smooth animations and a small amount of JavaScript to handle the event and class toggling.
